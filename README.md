# Among the Sleep

 _"Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,_     
 _The baiting place of wit, the balm of woe,_    
 _The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release."_                   
          —Sir Philip Sidney

Because lack of sleep leads to a multitude of negative conditions, it is important to research
topic.

Sleep disorders include, but are not limited to hypersomnolence disorder, obstructive sleep
apnea, hypopnea, central sleep apnea, sleep related hypoventilation, circadian rhythm
sleep-wake disorders, non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorders, nightmare disorder,
rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Some of these
disorders are commonly associated with time, for example, night terror disorder appears at
Stage 4 Non-REM sleep while nightmare disorder appears at REM Stage 5.

To date, the most studied sleep disorder is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome
(apnea) where the airway collapses during sleep. This leads to disturbances while sleeping.
There are other conditions aside from apneas which also impact the quality of sleep. These
conditions are known as sleep arousals. Some examples which can lead to these arousals are
teeth grinding (bruxisms), vocalizations, partial airway obstructions, and snoring.
The goal of the PhysioNet challenge is to identify non-apnea related arousals from data
collected during polysomnographic sleep studies. Polysomnography consists of EMG
(muscles), EOG (eyes), EEG (brain), and airflow in 20 minute nap session with sleep onset,
REM onset, Maintenance of Wakefulness, and Sedentary test.

The final model is for a course in Deep Learning, this model still requires fine tuning to improve the performance.
